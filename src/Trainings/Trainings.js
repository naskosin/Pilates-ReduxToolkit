        Pilates is a form of low impact exercise that aims to strengthen muscles whilst improving flexibility, mobility and postural alignment.
        
        It takes its name from Joseph Pilates who founded the exercise in the 1920s following his time in America following World War I. 
        
        He took inspiration from many types of exercise, including gymnastics and bodybuilding, as well as Eastern disciplines of yoga, tai chi and meditation, to create Pilates.</p>)
